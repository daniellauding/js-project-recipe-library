## What I built with

## Project requirements

- Building the HTML structure:
-- Input fields for filters and sorting options
-- A placeholder recipe card
- Styling your app as close as you can to figma design
- Writing JavaScript functions to handle user selections
- Using conditional statements to display a message to the user, based on the input
- Users should be able to select at least one filter
- Users should be able to select at least one sorting option
- Use functions to:
-- Get the selected filter
-- Check conditions (e.g. if the user selects "vegetarian", return "falafel")
- Should be responsive and look good on devices from 320px width up to at least 1600px.
